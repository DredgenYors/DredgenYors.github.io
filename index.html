                        <p>My name is Lindsay Goodwin, and I am an Assistant Professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology working in the Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research. Although I like to study a wide variety of topics within space physics, I am currently focusing most of my energy on magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. This stated, I am also quite familiar with ionospheric plasma physics, plasma-neutral interactions, and radio physics. I am also a lecturer.</p>

                        <p>A course is a nature park, the students are park visitors, and the instructor is a well-trained guide. The guide's goal is to get everyone to a beautiful vista, while being mindful of the strengths and weaknesses of the visitors. Some of the visitors may want to climb steep cliffs, while others may just want to walk the well-worn paths. Similarly, educators instruct students, connecting them to their goals while navigating the barriers and the strengths/weaknesses of the students along the way. Accordingly, my teaching and mentoring goal is to create a learning environment that is driven by the needs of the students.</p>
